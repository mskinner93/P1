     <h1>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You land on an mysterious island that is pretty far out from any other islands. You explore the island. It's abandon, nothing but a few wood scraps and human bones and remains, probably
    from someone who was stranded and died of starvation. You aren't sure which way to go, should you sail north or south?
