    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Captain! Captain! Wake up! You've been asleep for some time now." You open your eyes to see a man looking down at you. You look at your clothes and notice you have some sort of pirate
    captain uniform on. You are on a ship with a crew of men working all around you, they seem to be getting ready to set sail soon. You look at the man who was looking down at you and asks what is going on. He looks
    at you with a puzzled look. "Why dont you remember Captain? We are on the hunt for the teasure of the Great Captain "Blood Beard" and we are just about ready to depart." Even more puzzled then before he begins to
    tell you the story of the pirate Blood Beard. The story goes that Blood Beard was once the greatest pirate to ever sail the Great Ocean. He traveled all over collecting many treasures. Right before he died he hid
    the treasure somewhere so no one could find it. Your crew has collected some information that could help you find where this treasure is located. You also have a map of islands on the Great Ocean. Rumor has it
    Blood Beard had a hideout on an island called Foggy Island, maybe he could have left something behind. Blood Beard was also in many ship battles throughout his life, one famous one happening right before his death
    off the shore of Crab Island, perhaps the wreckage of one of his old ships could give a clue on where his treasure is.
