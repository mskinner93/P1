    a statue with a hole in it. You look through the hole and see an island out in the distance. You begin to sail out to the island. You find native people on the island, they seem to have lived on this island for
    sometime now. They are not sure what to think of you and look ready to attack. Should you demand that they put their weapons down or put your weapons down and try and make peace?
