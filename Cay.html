     <h1>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You sail to the Cay that Blood Beard was once trapped on. You find a camp fire and a stick in the ground. It looks like someone burned it. You dig up the stick to find a small box. You open
    the box and find coordinates to an unmarked island that is not on your map. You are so very close, you can feel the treasure. Your crew however is very tired and asks if they can rest. Do you stay the night or sail
    onward to the island?
