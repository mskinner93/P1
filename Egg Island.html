     <h1>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see a person waving their arms in the air from a distance. You anchor your ship on the island he's on and approach the person. He's an old man who is a little strange.
    He is the only one on this island. He begins to tell you about old wise tails, some of which are a little far-fetched. He asks where you are going and you tell him. He tells you that he's seen pirates in the area.
    He offers you and your crew to stay the night. You are a little unsure because he's a crazy old man and not sure what he could be up to.
