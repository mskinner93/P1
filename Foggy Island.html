    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out from the fog appears Foggy Island. You anchor your ship and you and your crew begin the search on the island. You come across a decaying group of small huts and begin to explore them.
    Most of the huts are empty however someone in your crew finds a gold coin buried in one of the huts. The coin seems to have birds on it with an outline of a shape. You pull out your map and find that the outline is
    actually an island called Seagull Island, which explains why the birds are on the coin.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's getting dark, you must make the decision to stay the night and let your crew rest or sail through the night to Seagull Island. Don't worry, your crew is not one bit tired and is
    perfectly capable of sailing through the night.
