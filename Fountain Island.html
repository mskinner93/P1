    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You explore Crab Island to find remains of Blood Beard's old ship. You find a drawing of an island call Fountain Island. You set sail to Fountain Island, known for it's tall rock formation
    that is filled with trees. The island is heavily forested but you stumbled across a single old hut. Inside you find a letter that is addressed to Black Beard. You can barely read what the letter says but the letter
    seems to be from a small island town to the west. The letter also looks like it was suppose to be sent to an island north of here. Should you go to the small town or the island the letter was suppose to go to?
