    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploring the ship you don't find much. It looks to be that it has been raided. What you do find is a piece of the ship with the words "Dutchman's Nightmare" written on it. You also find
    is a ship log that was hidden away on the ship. The log gives details that many of the ships parts were made at an island town called Pantmawr. You and your crew sail to Pantmawr to find any clues on Blood Beard's
    ship. When you arive, your crew docks and get supplies. You start to explore the town and meet many new people. You come across a pub where Blood Beard visited often. When you start asking about Blood Beard
    strangers start to give you weird looks. A man comes up to you and says that he knew of Blood Beard and his treasure and that many men went missing trying to find it. He also tells you of an island that Blood
    Beard spoke of often called Blue Leaf Island, where all the leafs on the planets have blue leaves. You and your crew rest up in the town's inn. As your ship is ready to sail a crew member tells you of
    some info he collected of an island with nothing but flowers on it and that it may hold a clue to Blood Beard.
