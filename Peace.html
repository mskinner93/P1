    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You put down your weapons and the natives see that you are friendly by giving them gifts. They have you celebrate with their tribe. The tribe's shaman tells you two stories. One is about a
    cay that Blood Beard was once trapped on. The other is about Dark Forest Island where Blood Beard was seen. However, he warns you that Dark Forest Island is a very dangerous place that many people have
    disappeared from.
