    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You make it to Seagull Island! The amount of Seagulls that engulfed the island is breathtaking. As you land on the island you noticed a bottle with a note inside. You open the bottle,
    "HELP!" was written on the note as well as some coordinances to an island. You put the note away and start exploring the island. You and your crew come across some very old boxes and crates, most of which are
    rotting. One of the crates had words that were barely legible, "Dutchman's Nightmare" it reads. One of your crew memeber's tells you that the Dutchman's Nightmare was the ship that was sunk near Crab Island and
    that it's very possible that Blood Beard was here right before that battle took place! As things are looking good you remember the letter you found in the bottle. Do you keep on your path for teasure or do you
    go to the coordinance's to help a stranger in distress?
