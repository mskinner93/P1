    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wow! What a great time we had. Time sure does fly by when you're having fun!" says your friend as you leave his house. You were at your friend's house all day and lost track of time, it's now dark out and you still
    need to walk home. You decide to take a short cut home through a field to avoid getting in trouble by your parent's for getting home so late. You've heard never to travel this field at night because people have gone
    missing walking across it, but you take the chance. As you're walking it's very dark out. You can't see ahead of you, the moon isn't seen in the sky. You keep walking for what you think is halfway across the field,
    nothing is around you, you just hope that you're going the right way. You take a step, all of a sudden the ground gives way! You find yourself falling down a huge hole! "AHHHHHH" you scream as you fall into the
    abyss.
